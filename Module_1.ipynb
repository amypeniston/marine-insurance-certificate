    "### History of Marine Insurance\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, insurance law has shifted from protecting the ignorant insurer against the concealment of facts to protecting the insured from the heavy-handed insurer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The focus is on English law, which is widely respected all over the world and forms the basis of insurance law in many different countries (ex: Australia). Note that although it is codified to a large extent by the Act of 1906, it is chiefly established by judicial decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The earliest records of naval insurance appear in work by Dillani, an Italian historian, who cited a system developed in 1182. \"The Chronyk Van Vaen Vern\" contains the first mention of a marine insurance market in 1310. The merchants of Hanseatic League appear to be the first to create such a market, which consisted of a membership fo 86 towns. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Bottomry:** A contract in the nature of a mortgage by which money is borrowed using the ship and the cargo as security. This money would then be applied to the necessities of a ship. Interest is paid to the lender and both principal and interest are forfeited if the ship is lost on the voyage. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Respondentia:** Similar to bottomry, but using only the cargo as security. Money borrowed is used for the necessities of the cargo only.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1236, Pope Gregory IX stipulated that a sum of money must be paid by the merchant to the lender - a premia - in order to obtain the loan.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lloyd's Policy Form**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Developed in 1779; remained practically unchanged until 1982 for cargo and 1983 for hull\n",
    "* First alteration was in 1850, when opening sentence was changed from \"in the name of God, Amen\" to \"Be it known that\"\n",
    "* In 1874, the Waiver Clause was inserted following the Sue and Labour Clause - this enabled both parties to take measures to preserve the assets without prejudicing his rights regarding settlement\n",
    "* In 1919, the Frustration Clause was added in response to Sanday v. British & Foreign Marine Insurance Co - this dealt with losses due to inability to execute a contract\n",
    "* One particularity of note is the appearance of letters \"S.G.\" in the marginal note in Schedule 1 - a number of theories have been put forth as to the meaning of these letters, ranging from simple abbreviations to Latin/Italian phrases.\n",
    "* An agreement in 1918 outlined that Lloyd's underwriters will not subscribe to any policy which does not bear the impression of the Lloyd's Anchor Seal\n",
    "\n",
    "The first legal decision was in 1555 and the first Marine Insurance legislation was the Act setting up the Court of Policies in 1601. The Court was formed to arbitrate in cases of dispute arising in London, but fell out of use as decisions were not binding. \n",
    "\n",
    "In 1720, the Royal Exchange Assurance and the London Assurance were granted sole privilege of insuring marine risks. \n",
    "\n",
    "In 1756, Lord Mansfield became Chief Justice of the Court of King's Bench. Under his reign, the number of reported cases grew enormously and the manner in which juries make decisions was vastly improved. Lord Mansfield is largely responsible for the nature of marine insurance law to this day.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Insurance Act 1601\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"The loss falleth lightly on the many, rather than heavily on the few\" \n",
    "\n",
    "Insurance is grounded on the transfer of fortuitous risk: for consideration (premium), the insured transfers the uncertainty of loss to the insurer. In turn, the insurer uses the premiums of the many to pay for the losses of the few. Through experience, the insurer is able to predict the frequency/severity of various hazards. Marine insurance can be considered a contract of indemnity and protection from exposure to various risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **The Marine Insurance Act, 1788** required that policies contain the name of the assured\n",
    "* **Marine Insurance Act, 1745** was passed to prohibit the issue of wagering policies and the creative use of \"Policy is Proof of Interest\" (PPI) policies\n",
    "* **The Stamp Act, 1746** required contracts to be written\n",
    "* **The Marine Assurance Act, 1824** abolished the monopoly granted to the Royal Exchange Assurance and the London Assurance Corporations by Act of 1720, allowing companies to be formed to transact marine assurance business\n",
    "* **The Stamp Act, 1831** required contracts contain certain particulars and prohibited policies spanning more than 12 months\n",
    "* **The Gaming Act, 1845** extended the provisions of the Act of 1745\n",
    "* **The Revenue Act (No. 2), 1884** legalized reinsurance, which had been prohibited by the Act of 1745\n",
    "* **The Policies of Marine Insurance Act, 1868** provided for assignment of policies and granted assignees power to sue\n",
    "* **The Finance Act, 1901** allowed the continuation clause subject to an additional stamp duty\n",
    "* **The Revenue Act, 1903** allowed building risk policies to run for periods longer than 12 months and be stamped as voyage policies\n",
    "* **The Marine Insurance Act, 1906** - see below\n",
    "* **The Marine Insurance (Gambling Policies) Act, 1909** amplified the provisions of the 1906 Act as to wagering and gaming policies, making it a criminal offence for insurances to be issued where assured has no interest/expectation of acquiring interest\n",
    "* **The Consumer Insurance (Disclosure and Representations) Act, 2012** alters the disclosure requirements for consumer insurance contracts\n",
    "* **The Insurance Act, 2015** makes significant changes to insurance law particularly in respect of the duty of utmost good faith and warranties\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Marine Insurance Act 1906\n",
    "\n",
    "This Act reproduced as faithfully as possible the case law built up by Lord Mansfied and his successors. It repealed the Acts of 1745, 1788 and 1868, however a number of provisions were reproduced in similar form. Note that the Act does not prescribe any particular form of policy, but a Lloyd's form is provided in the First Schedule. Not until 2012 and 2015 were there any changes made to the Act.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key provisions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Every contract of marine insurance must be embodied in a policy\n",
    "* Every policy must contain key info such as: assured/agent name, subject-matter insured, covered perils, voyage or time parameters, sums insured and UW names\n",
    "* Every policy must be stamped in accordance with the in-force Finance Act\n",
    "* Every policy must be signed by the UWs/authorized agents\n",
    "\n",
    "The Act of 1906 codifies court case decisions that formalized the interpretation of the policy. Modern requirements have been tacked on using ad hoc clauses.\n"

    "#### Utmost Good Faith\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike normal contracts, which are subject to the doctrine of good faith, insurance is historically subject to the doctrine of utmost good faith: this requires total disclosure of all facts that might affect the judgement of a prudent insurer as well as the total disclosure of all facts the insured needs to assess the appropriateness of the policy (note: applies to non-consumer only). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Scope of Marine Insurance\n",
    "\n",
    "* Cover is provided for losses incidental to a marine adventure\n",
    "* Risk must be fortuitous, i.e. there must be an element of chance\n",
    "* \"Perils of the sea\" is a risk that does not encompass everything that might befall the insured at sea\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Physical and Moral Hazard\n",
    "\n",
    "Hazards are those factors which increase the occurrence, frequency or severity of a loss. These can be either physical - related to the physical characteristics of a risk - or moral - related to human involvement. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Risk\n",
    "\n",
    "Risk is any situation capable of giving rise to loss, injury, damage or liability. It is the possibility of an event occurring. Contrast this with speculative risks, which might result in an outcome that ranges from loss to gain, or pure risks, which is the uncertainty as to whether an loss will occur. "

    "### Important Terms\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Average:** loss\n",
    "* **Particular average:** partial loss\n",
    "* **General average:** a loss that is subject to ratable contribution from the other interested parties\n",
    "* **Particular charge:** refers to a suing and labouring expense or to forwarding charges\n",
    "* **Actual total loss:** a total loss both in law and in fact\n",
    "* **Constructive total loss:** a total loss in law only, i.e. a \"deemed\" total loss - preservation expenditures would exceed actual value\n",
    "* **Perils of the seas:** one of the perils normally covered in a marine hull and machinery policy, ex: a storm, grounding, collision (though not 3rd party liability resulting from collision, which would need to be insured separately); note that lightning is not a peril of the sea\n",
    "* **Barratry:** wrongful acts committed by the master or crew to prejudice of the owner/charterer\n",
    "* **Implied terms:** terms that are \"deemed\" to exist even though not expressly written in the contract, ex: legality\n",
    "* **Valued policy:** specifies the agreed value of the subject-matter insured\n",
    "* **Unvalued policy:** does not specify the value of the subject-matter insured but, subject to stated limit, leaves insurable value to be ascertained subsequently\n",
    "* **Subrogation:** outlines insurer's rights and remedies post-loss"

    "#### The Requirement of Insurable Interest\n",
    "\n",
    "By 1906, insurable interest was an intrinsic feature of every valid policy. Sections 4 and 5 of the Act of 1906 provides for the avoidance of wagering or gaming contracts, in which the assured does not have an insurable interest of expectation of acquiring interest. Persons with insurable interest include those who are interested in a marine adventure, i.e. anyone who stands to benefit or be prejudiced by a marine adventure: owners, mortgagees, mortgagors, bailees, agents, persons exposed to liability and insurers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key points:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The assured must be interested in the insured subject-matter at the time of the loss - not necessarily at the time the insurance is effected.\n",
    "* A marine policy is assignable unless it contains terms expressly prohibiting assignment. It can be assigned before or after loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Insurable Interest - Recent Developments**\n",
    "\n",
    "There is some evidence that English courts may be increasingly lenient when it comes to who is able to recover under a hull policy (The Moonacre (1992)). In The Martin P (2005), the judge declared:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ownership/possession is not a necessary requirement\n",
    "* A legal right to use goods may be sufficient to constitute an insurable interest\n",
    "* An insurable interest may also be derived from the inability to carry out work\n",
    "* Commercial convenience is a relevant factor\n",
    "* A person may insure the property itself and use proceeds to cover an amount for which he is liable, even if the damage occurred without an actionable fault on his part. "

    "#### Utmost Good Faith\n",
    "\n",
    "> Although commercial policies are still governed by the contract of utmost good faith, recent changes have impacted the responsibilities of the insured as regards consumer insurance.\n",
    "\n",
    "As outlined in the Marine Insurance Act of 1906 (sections 17 to 20), derived from the judgment of Lord Mansfield in Carter v. Boehm (1766), a contract of marine insurance is a contract based upon the utmost good faith, and, if not observed, the contract may be avoided by the other party.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The assured/agent must disclose to the insurer every material circumstance known to the assured/agent, or which should have been know to the assured/agent. Thus, the assured has a **positive duty to speak** up to the conclusion of the contract.\n",
    "* Something is material if it would **influence the judgment** of a prudent insurer in fixing premium or determining whether to take on the risk. It is not necessary to prove that the prudent insurer would have acted differently, only that the circumstances would have had an impact on the formation of opinion. Influence the mind != change the mind.\n",
    "* The material non-disclosure or misrepresentation must have helped induce the making of the contract.\n",
    "* Some items do not need to be disclosed, ex: anything that diminishes the risk, circumstances that a prudent insurer should have known or has waived.\n",
    "* The obligation of disclosure applies to all underwriters working on the contract. \n",
    "* If full disclosure is not made, the underwriter must return the premium; no claims will be payable. There is no issue of \"guilt\". Avoidance is the only remedy for breach under the original Act of 1906.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Consumer Insurance (Disclosure and Representations) Act, 2012**\n",
    "\n",
    "For consumer contracts (i.e. those unrelated to an individual's trade), the doctrine of utmost good faith was revised to be a less burdensome obligation: consumers must take reasonable care not to make a misrepresentation. Likewise, insurer's remedies against breach were amended to vary based on the type of misrepresentation (deliberate, reckless or careless). \n",
    "\n",
    "**The Insurance Act, 2015**\n",
    "\n",
    "The 2015 Act came into force on August 12th, 2016 and resulted in major changes to utmost good faith requirements for non-consumer insurance. It stipulates that before a contract be entered into, the insured must make to the insurer a fair presentation of the risk. In relation to deemed knowledge, section 4 offers guidelines for cases in which the insured is a corporation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, the dumping of information on the insurer is unlikely to be viewed as \"fair presentation\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The remedy for a breach is no longer \"one size fits all\", as outlined in the Act of 1906. Instead, the Act of 2015 outlines a proportionate/gradated approach. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Post-Contractual Duty**\n",
    "\n",
    "Post-contractual duties are not the same as those applying pre-contract. There is no duty on the assured to volunteer information unless it is specified in the contract or the assured is seeking to amend the contract. \n",
    "\n",
    "Significant controversy surrounds fraudulent claims, including not merely an exaggeration of loss but also when figures in good faith are persisted even after the realization that they are exaggerated. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the insured presents fraudulent claims:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The insurer is not liable to pay the claim\n",
    "* The insurer may recover from the insured any sums paid to the insured in respect of the claim\n",
    "* The insurer may terminate the contract as from the time of the fraudulent act\n",
    "\n",
    "In The DC Merwerstone 2016, the Court held that an irrelevant lie, i.e. a collateral lie, would not affect the insured's right to claim. In this case, the lie does not impact the existence or amount of entitlement and therefore does not disqualify the insured from being reimbursed."

    "#### Warranties\n",
    "\n",
    "> The Insurance Act of 2015 amendments apply only to contracts entered into on or after August 12th, 2016.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a stark difference between warranties in English law of contract and warranties in English marine insurance law. Breach of warranty in English law of contract entitles the innocent party to receive damages caused by the breach. In contrast, marine insurance law dictates that warranties are contractual promises given by the assured. The effect of a breach depends on whether the contracts are enforced by section 33 of the Marine Insurance Act of 1906 or the amendments of the Insurance Act of 2015. \n",
    "\n",
    "Key points:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Most express warranties in marine policies will incorporate the word \"warranted\", however the presence or absence of the word \"warranted\" is not conclusive.\n",
    "* Warranties can be express or implied.\n",
    "* Prior to 2015, failure to comply with a warranty discharged the insurer from liability as from the date of breach because the fulfilment of a warranty is by definition a condition precedent to the liability of the insurer. There is no requirement for the insurer to give notice or for the breach to be causative of a loss. Insureds cannot remedy it and then reverse their position. In certain rare circumstances, breach of warranty may be excused. Finally, a breach of warranty may be waived by the insurer. \n",
    "* The parties can contractually override the provisions of a warranty using a **\"held covered clause\"**, ex: \"Held covered in case of any breach of warranty...\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Seaworthiness**\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important implied warranties are those concerning seaworthiness, which is treated differently for voyage polices (i.e. cargo) versus time policies (i.e. hull).  \n",
    "\n",
    "* Voyage Policies: There is an implied warranty that at the commencement of the voyage, the ship will be seaworthy for the insured marine adventure. For cargo policies, there is no implied warranty that goods are seaworthy, however it is warranted that the ship is reasonably fit to carry the goods. Note that the current Institute Cargo Clauses waive these implied warranties in their entirety and include an unseaworthiness and unfitness exclusion.\n",
    "* Time Policies: There is no implied warranty that the ship will be seaworthy at an stage of the adventure, however the ship must be in a seaworthy state when it is sent to sea. For underwriters to defend their case, the loss must be attributable to unseaworthiness to which the assured was privy. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Privity**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case where a loss occurs due to unseaworthiness, the privity, or knowledge, of the assured must be proved. This was detailed in The Eurysthenes (1976), from which stemmed the concept of \"blind eye knowledge\", and later in The Star Sea (1997).\n",
    "\n",
    "First, it is necessary to determine **who is the assured**. For corporations or complex ownership structures, this usually includes those individuals who have the decision-making power of the assured company. A company is **not** said to possess cumulative knowledge of all relevant individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "In The Star Sea, it was determined that the assured had no actual knowledge of the unseaworthiness of the vessel. Instead, the question was whether the assured had \"blind eye knowledge\". This was found to be a subjective test. If there is a suspicion that the individuals did not enquire for feature of having certain knowledge, then a finding of privity must by made. \"Blind eye knowledge\" is the deliberate decision to avoid confirmation of facts in whose experience the individual has good reason to believe are true. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Warranty of Legality**\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the Act of 1906, there is an implied warranty that adventures be lawful and carried out in a lawful manner. Note that the payment of ransom to pirates is not illegal, however payment of ransom to terrorists is illegal.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Insurance Act of 2015**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Act of 2015 imposes a major change to warranties, abolishing any rule of law that results in the discharge of the insurer's liability under the contract. Instead, breach is considered a **suspensive condition**, as the insurer will be liable for losses occurring after the breach if that breach has subsequently been remedied."

    "#### Contract Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "Courts are faced with the choice of applying a literal interpretation to phrases/words or whether to give an interpretation that makes business sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In Rainy Sky v. Kookmin Bank (2011), it was determined that the court is entitled to prefer the interpretation which is consistent with business common sense. All relevant surrounding circumstances must be regarded.\n",
    "* In Arnold v. Britton (2015), it was concluded that judges should avoid re-writing a contract to assist an unwise party or penalize an astute party. Imprudent terms are often agreed upon and should not be rejected simply because they appear imprudent.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Late Payment of Claims\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Enterprise Act of 2016**\n",
    "\n",
    "Amends the Act of 2015 to enable insured to claim the damages actually suffered as a result of insurers' unjustified late payments. The insurer is obliged to indemnify the insured within a \"reasonable time\", which depends on the specific circumstances, including the type of insurance, the size/complexity of the claim, relevant regulatory rules and factors outside the insurers' control."

    "### The London Market\n",
    "\n",
    "* 1310: The first Chamber of Insurance was established in Bruges. Italian and Flemish merchants are believed to have worked out of London during this time.\n",
    "* 1524: Earliest written evidence of insurance in England is found in the records of legal cases involving the Admiralty Courts.\n",
    "* 1567: The destruction of Antwerp by the Spanish helped give London a much bigger role.\n",
    "* 1570: The first Royal Exchange (modelled on Antwerp Bourse) gave merchants a place to transact business in cargoes and insurance. The Chamber of Assurance provided policy admin services. \n",
    "* 1601: The first English insurance legislation was passed. By now, the use of brokers to place insurances was the norm. All early market activity was related to marine insurance specifically. It was not until much later that fire, accident and liability insurance was devised. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the early 20th century, there were few regulations to restrict a company's ability to write insurance. That changed when, after the Second World War, local insurers were required to write local risks. These companies were unable to retain all of the risk, which gave rise to the a facultative and treaty reinsurance market. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most well known part of the market is Lloyd's, which initially included only individual non-corporate insurers called \"Names\". Nowadays, companies may also operate through the Lloyd's system. \n",
    "\n",
    "Business written in the London market includes: US excess and surplus lines, cat reinsurance, treaty reinsurance, fac reinsurance, specialty risks, energy, marine and aviation. Many specialty policies forms have been created, although unusual risks still often require bespoke products. London remains a major center for legal resolution, even though alternative dispute resolutions has grown in popularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to a host of independent entities that support the London market, including accountants, actuaries, etc., there is the specialist association bureaux, which is responsible for the centralized processing of closings, accounting and settlement. Protection and Indemnity Clubs (P&I), which are the backbone of the marine liability market, have a heavy presence in London. \n",
    "\n",
    "Of particular importance to the London market are brokers, who have a special role in marketing and servicing both clients and underwriters. They are no mere insurance agents; instead they travel extensively to produce business, help to create new products and negotiate claims. Brokers take advantage of London's close-knit community and social contact, perhaps the city's biggest advantage, to place insurance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**London Market Companies**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Underwriting records must be precisely maintained so that limits and guidelines can be adhered to and appropriate fac can be purchased.\n",
    "* The London Processing Centre handles detailed policy checking will advise on items closed and accounting settlements.\n",
    "* Actuaries prepare detailed statistics for underwriting and reporting in addition to determining IBNR, accumulations and pricing.\n",
    "* Funds are invested - either short-term (for smaller companies) or in a diverse portfolio (for larger companies).\n",
    "* Personnel managers deal with staffing and training for clients, brokers and others. \n",
    "* Reinsurance is purchased for the desired retention and cover. \n",
    "* Outside adjusters and lawyers are retained for speedy and cost-efficient claims handling.\n",
    "* The benefit of a concentrated market (geographically) is that it is possible to call meetings at short notice. The market is very responsive, highly aware and flexible. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Brokers**\n",
    "\n",
    "The main functions of the broker are to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Take instructions from the client\n",
    "* Execute instructions efficiently\n",
    "* Assist with claims negotiations\n",
    "\n",
    "These functions encompass a wide range of responsibilities, from staying abreast of markets, understanding clients' businesses, collecting/remitting premiums and maintaining records. \n",
    "\n",
    "Brokers are, in law, the agent of the buyer, despite being paid a commission by the insurer. They carry out extensive yet speculative marketing work, in that they do not receive compensation unless business is completed and the premium received. This gives the London market a unique no-risk marketing department. \n",
    "\n",
    "With their vast market knowledge, brokers assist clients with risk management and advise on available coverages. They also evaluate the security of potential insurers and are responsible for limiting cost to their clients in the event of insurer default. Brokers also provide in-house training.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a given risk, the broker approaches and negotiates with a number of underwriters who specialize in the relevant class of business. All information is summarized on a \"slip\". The broker continues to seek support from various underwriters who, if they are satisfied as to the viability of the risk, will quote a rate. A final premium is agreed upon and the underwriter signs a line representing the proportion of the risk he is prepared to accept. The process repeats until the whole value of the risk is covered.\n",
    "\n",
    "In presenting a risk, the broker must:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Present all material and relevant information\n",
    "* Represent the client's best interests\n",
    "* Ensure that all information is eventually given in writing and recorded/acknowledged by the insurers in writing\n",
    "\n",
    "Internal documentation systems are used to make sure that all telephone conversations and other \"brief\" meetings are recorded. Vital info must not be buried or lost. \n",
    "\n",
    "The insurer's agreement to go on risk must always be recorded and confirmed in writing. Cover may be agreed over the phone, however brokers must make every effort to immediately record the call and dispatch written confirmation as soon as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overplacing**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a handful of different reasons why brokers may overplace a risk:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Brokers bait a large line on a good risk to compensate for supporting a bad risk - thus the good risk is overplaced.\n",
    "* Brokers entice underwriters with a good rate on a good risk in exchange for writing something less desirable - thus the good risk is overplaced.\n",
    "* The \"Respect the Lead\" agreement, to which most London insurers subscribe.\n",
    "* Brokers intentionally overplace a risk to hedge against a contraction of the market for this particular risk.\n",
    "* For political reasons, i.e. some risks must be offered to every insurer within a certain market.\n",
    "\n",
    "When there is an oversubscription, the London market will conduct a process of signing down participants.\n",

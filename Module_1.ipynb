    "#### History of Marine Insurance\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, insurance law has shifted from protecting the ignorant insurer against the concealment of facts to protecting the insured from the heavy-handed insurer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The focus is on English law, which is widely respected all over the world and forms the basis of insurance law in many different countries (ex: Australia). Note that although it is codified to a large extent by the Act of 1906, it is chiefly established by judicial decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The earliest records of naval insurance appear in work by Dillani, an Italian historian, who cited a system developed in 1182. \"The Chronyk Van Vaen Vern\" contains the first mention of a marine insurance market in 1310. The merchants of Hanseatic League appear to be the first to create such a market, which consisted of a membership fo 86 towns. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Bottomry:** A contract in the nature of a mortgage by which money is borrowed using the ship and the cargo as security. This money would then be applied to the necessities of a ship. Interest is paid to the lender and both principal and interest are forfeited if the ship is lost on the voyage. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Respondentia:** Similar to bottomry, but using only the cargo as security. Money borrowed is used for the necessities of the cargo only.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1236, Pope Gregory IX stipulated that a sum of money must be paid by the merchant to the lender - a premia - in order to obtain the loan.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lloyd's Policy Form**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Developed in 1779; remained practically unchanged until 1982 for cargo and 1983 for hull\n",
    "* First alteration was in 1850, when opening sentence was change dfrom \"in the name of God, Amen\" to \"Be it known that\"\n",
    "* In 1874, the Waiver Clause was inserted following the Sue and Labour Clause - this enabled both parties to take measures to preserve the assets without prejudicing his rights regarding settlement\n",
    "* In 1919, the Frustration Clause was added in response to Sanday v. British & Foreign Marine Insurance Co - this dealt with losses due to inability to execute a contract\n",
    "* One particularity of note is the appearance of letters \"S.G.\" in the marginal note in Schedule 1 - a number of theories have been put forth as to the meaning of these letters, ranging from simple abbreviations to Latin/Italian phrases.\n",
    "* An agreement in 1918 outlined that Lloyd's underwriters will not subscribe to any policy which does not bear the impression of the Lloyd's Anchor Seal\n",
    "\n",
    "The first legal decision was in 1555 and the first Marine Insurance legislation was the Act setting up the Court of Policies in 1601. The Court was formed to arbitrate in cases of dispute arising in London, but fell out of use as decisions were not binding. \n",
    "\n",
    "In 1720, the Royal Exchange Assurance and the London Assurance were granted sole privilege of insuring marine risks. \n",
    "\n",
    "In 1756, Lord Mansfield became Chief Justice of the Court of King's Bench. Under his reign, the number of reported cases grew enormously and the manner in which juries make decisions was vastly improved. Lord Mansfield is largely responsible for the nature of marine insurance law to this day.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Insurance Act 1601\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"The loss falleth lightly on the many, rather than heavily on the few\" \n",
    "\n",
    "Insurance is grounded on the transfer of fortuitous risk: for consideration (premium), the insured transfers the uncertainty of loss to the insurer. In turn, the insurer uses the premiums of the many to pay for the losses of the few. Through experience, the insurer is able to predict the frequency/severity of various hazards.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **The Marine Insurance Act, 1788** required that policies contain the name of the assured\n",
    "* **Marine Insurance Act, 1745** was passed to prohibit the issue of wagering policies and the creative use of \"Policy is Proof of Interest\" (PPI) policies\n",
    "* **The Stamp Act, 1746** required contracts to be written\n",
    "* **The Marine Assurance Act, 1824** abolished the monopoly granted to the Royal Exchange Assurance and the London Assurance Corporations by Act of 1720, allowing companies to be formed to transact marine assurance business\n",
    "* **The Stamp Act, 1831** required contracts contain certain particulars and prohibited policies spanning more than 12 months\n",
    "* **The Gaming Act, 1845** extended the provisions of the Act of 1745\n",
    "* **The Revenue Act (No. 2), 1884** legalised reinsurance, which had been prohibited by the Act of 1745\n",
    "* **The Policies of Marine Insurance Act, 1868** provided for assignment of policies and granted assignees power to sue\n",
    "* **The Finance Act, 1901** allowed the continuation clause subject to an additional stamp duty\n",
    "* **The Revenue Act, 1903** allowed building risk policies to run for periods longer than 12 months and be stamped as voyage policies\n",
    "* **The Marine Insurance Act, 1906** - see below\n",
    "* **The Marine Insurance (Gambling Policies) Act, 1909** amplified the provisions of the 1906 Act as to wagering and gaming policies, making it a criminal offence for insurances to be issued where assured has no interest/expectation of acquiring interest\n",
    "* **The Consumer Insurance (Disclosure and Representations) Act, 2012** alters the disclosure requirements for consumer insurance contracts\n",
    "* **The Insurance Act, 2015** makes significant changes to insurance law particularly in respect of the duty of utmost good faith and warranties\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Marine Insurance Act 1906\n",
    "\n",
    "This Act reproduced as faithfully as possible the case law built up by Lord Mansfied and his successors. It repealed the Acts of 1745, 1788 and 1868, however a number of provisions were reproduced in similar form. Note that the Act does not prescribe any particular form of policy, but a Lloyd's form is provided in the First Schedule. Not until 2012 and 2015 were there any changes made to the Act.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key provisions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Every contract of marine insurance must be embodied in a policy\n",
    "* Every policity must contain key info such as: assured/agent name, subject-matter insured, covered perils, voyage or time parameters, sums insured and UW names\n",
    "* Every policy must be stamped in accordance with the in-force Finance Act\n",
    "* Every policy must be signed by the UWs/authorized agents\n",
    "\n",
    "The Act of 1906 codifies court case decisions that formalized the interpretation of the policy. Modern requirements have been tacked on using ad hoc clauses.\n"

    "#### Utmost Good Faith\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike normal contracts, which are subject to the doctrine of good faith, insurance is historically subject to the doctrine of utmost good faith: this requires total disclosure of all facts that might affect the judgement of a prudent insurer as well as the total disclosure of all facts the insured needs to assess the appropriateness of the policy (note: applies to non-consumer only). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Scope of Marine Insurance\n",
    "\n",
    "* Cover is provided for losses incidental to a marine adventure\n",
    "* Risk must be fortuitous, i.e. there must be an element of chance\n",
    "* \"Perils of the sea\" is a risk that does not encompass everything that might befall the insured at sea\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Physical and Moral Hazard\n",
    "\n",
    "Hazards are those facotrs which increase the occurrence, frequency or severity of a loss. These can be either physical - related to the physical characteristics of a risk - or moral - related to human involvement. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Risk\n",
    "\n",
    "Risk is any situation capable of giving rise to loss, injury, damage or liability. It is the possibility of an event occurring. Contrast this with speculative risks, which might result in an outcome that ranges from loss to gain, or pure risks, which is the uncertainty as to whether an loss will occur. "

    "#### Important Terms\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Average:** loss\n",
    "* **Particular average:** partial loss\n",
    "* **General average:** a loss that is subject to rateable contributon from the other interested parties\n",
    "* **Particular charge:** refers to a suing and labouring expense or to forwarding charges\n",
    "* **Actual total loss:** a total loss both in law and in fact\n",
    "* **Constructive total loss:** a total loss in law only, i.e. a \"deemed\" total loss - preservation expenditures would exceed actual value\n",
    "* **Perils of the seas:** one of the perils normally covered in a marine hull and machinery policy, ex: a storm, grounding, collision (though not 3rd party liability resulting from collision, which would need to be insured separately)\n",
    "* **Barratry:** wrongful acts commited by the master or crew to prejudice of the owner/charterer\n",
    "* **Implied terms:** terms that are \"deemed\" to exist even though not expressly written in the contract, ex: legality\n",
    "* **Valued policy:** specifies the agreed value of the subject-matter insured\n",
    "* **Unvalued policy:** does not specify the value of the subject-matter insured but, subject to stated limit, leaves insurable value to be ascertained subsequently\n",
    "* **Subrogration:** outlines insurer's rights and remedies post-loss"

    "#### The Requirement of Insurable Interest\n",
    "\n",
    "By 1906, insurable interest was an intrinsic feature of every valid policy. Sections 4 and 5 of the Act of 1906 provides for the avoidance of wagering or gaming contracts, in which the assured does not have an insurable interest of expectation of acquiring interest. Persons with insurable interest include those who are interested in a marine adventure, i.e. anyone who stands to benefit or be prejudiced by a marine adventure: owners, mortgagees, mortgagors, bailees, agents, persons exposed to liability and insurers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key points:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The assured must be intersted in the insured subject-matter at the time of the loss - not necessarily at the time the insurance is effected.\n",
    "* A marine policy is assignable unless it contains terms expressly prohibiting assignment. It can be assigned before or after loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Insurable Interest - Recent Developments *\n",
    "\n",
    "There is some evidence that English courts may be increasingly lenient when it comes to who is able to recover under a hull policy (The Moonacre (1992)). In The Martin P (2005), the judge declared:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ownership/possession is not a necessary requirement\n",
    "* A legal right to use goods may be sufficient to sonstitute an insurable interest\n",
    "* An insurable interest may also be derived from the inability to carry out work\n",
    "* Commercial convenience is a relevant factor\n",
    "* A person may insure the property itself and use proceeds to cover an amount for which he is liable, even if the damage occurred without an actionable fault on his part. "

    "\n",
    "> Although commercial policies are still goverened by the contract of utmost good faith, recent changes have impacted the responsibilites of the insured as regards consumer insurance.\n",
    "\n",
    "As outlined in the Marine Inusrance Act of 1906 (sections 17 to 20), derived from the judgment of Lord Mansfield in Carter v. Boehm (1766), a contract of marine insurance is a contract based upon the utmost good faith, and, if not observed, the contract may be avoided by the other party.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The assured/agent must disclose to the insurer every material circumstance known to the assured/agent, or which should have been know to the assured/agent. Thus, the assured has a **positive duty to speak** up to the conclusion of the contract.\n",
    "* Something is material if it would **influence the judgment** of a prudent insurer in fixing premium or determining whether to take on the risk. It is not necessary to prove that the prudent insurer would have acted differently, only that the circumstances would have had an impact on the formation of opinion. Influence the mind != change the mind.\n",
    "* The material non-disclosure or misrepresentation must have helped induce the making of the contract.\n",
    "* Some items do not need to be disclosed, ex: anything that diminishes the risk, circumstances that a prudent insurer should have known or has waived.\n",
    "* The obligation of disclosure applies to all underwriters working on the contract. \n",
    "* If full disclosure is not made, the underwriter must return the premium; no claims will be payable. There is no issue of \"guilt\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Consumer Insurance (Disclosure and Representations) Act, 2012**\n",
    "\n",
    "For consumer contracts (i.e. those unrelated to an individual's trade), the doctrine of utmost good faith was revised to be a less burdensome obligation: consumers must take reasonable care not to make a misrepresentation. Likewise, insurer's remedies against breach were amended to vary based on the type of misrepresentation (deliberate, reckless or careless). \n",
    "\n",
    "**The Insurance Act, 2015**\n",
    "\n",
    "The 2015 Act came into force on August 12th, 2016 and resulted in major changes to utmost good faith requirements for non-consumer insurance. It stipulates that before a contract be entered into, the insured must make to the insurer a fair presentation of the risk. In relation to deemed knowledge, section 4 offers guidelines for cases in which the insured is a corporation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, the dumping of information on the insurer is unlikely to be viewed as \"fair presenation\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The remedy for a breach is no longer \"one size fits all\", as outlined in the Act of 1906. Instead, the Act of 2015 outlines a proportionate/gradated approach. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Post-Contractual Duty**\n",
    "\n",
    "Post-contractual duties are not the same as those applying pre-contract. There is no duty on the assured to volunteer information unless it is specified in the contract or the assured is seeking to amend the contract. \n",
    "\n",
    "Significant controversy surrounds fraudulent claims, including not merely an exaggeration of loss but also when figures in good faith are persisted even after the realization that they are exaggerated. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the insured presents fraudulent claims:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The insurer is not liable to pay the claim\n",
    "* The insurer may recover from the insured any sums paid to the insured in respect of the claim\n",
    "* The insurer may terminate the contract as from the time of the fraudulent act\n",
    "\n",
    "In The DC Merwerstone 2016, the Court held that an irrelevant lie, i.e. a collateral lie, would not affect the insured's right to claim. In this case, the lie does not impact the existence or amount of entitlement and therefore "
